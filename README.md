The dataset may be synthetic, but the experience it provides is anything but! In this report, I've carefully crafted essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to give you a snapshot of the data:
### KPI's
#
* Total Sales: $2.33M
* Total Orders: 10.19K
* CY Sales: $745.57K
* PY Sales: $613.93K
* YoY Growth: 21.44%
* Total Profit: $291.30K
#

But that's not all! Here are some captivating insights from my analysis:

* Total Sales by Segment Analysis: Discover which segment reigns supreme, with the "Replacement" segment taking the lead.
* Sales by Booking Type Analysis: Uncover customer preferences as "Pre-Book" bookings dominate the sales.
* Sales by Car Color Analysis: Witness the magic of "Pale White," the most sought-after car color.
* Sales by Region: Explore geographic trends as the "West" region commands the highest sales.
#

The user experience is further enriched by compelling visualizations:
* "Total Orders by Company" - Quickly identify the companies ruling the sales charts and those with room for improvement.

* "Top 3 Companies by Profit" - Uncover the heavy-hitters in profitability.

* "Total Sales by Month" and "Total Profit by Month" charts let you dive into sales seasonality and profitability dynamics.

* I've gone the extra mile with separate charts for "Top 3 Models by Sales and Profit," offering deeper insights into model performance.
