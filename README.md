# Car-Sales-Dashboard-New-Style-With-Graphical-Interface

## Overview this project
Exciting News! I've just unveiled a revolutionary Power BI car sales dashboard with an innovative graphical interface. This dashboard not only offers stunning visuals but also provides invaluable insights for budding data analysts.

The dataset may be synthetic, but the experience it provides is anything but! In this report, I've carefully crafted essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to give you a snapshot of the data:

### KPI's
#
* Total Sales: $2.33M
* Total Orders: 10.19K
* CY Sales: $745.57K
* PY Sales: $613.93K
* YoY Growth: 21.44%
* Total Profit: $291.30K
#

But that's not all! Here are some captivating insights from my analysis:

* Total Sales by Segment Analysis: Discover which segment reigns supreme, with the "Replacement" segment taking the lead.
* Sales by Booking Type Analysis: Uncover customer preferences as "Pre-Book" bookings dominate the sales.
* Sales by Car Color Analysis: Witness the magic of "Pale White," the most sought-after car color.
* Sales by Region: Explore geographic trends as the "West" region commands the highest sales.
#

The user experience is further enriched by compelling visualizations:
* "Total Orders by Company" - Quickly identify the companies ruling the sales charts and those with room for improvement.

* "Top 3 Companies by Profit" - Uncover the heavy-hitters in profitability.

* "Total Sales by Month" and "Total Profit by Month" charts let you dive into sales seasonality and profitability dynamics.

* I've gone the extra mile with separate charts for "Top 3 Models by Sales and Profit," offering deeper insights into model performance.
